# KeyTool Utility Project

This project try to simplify common operation with KeyTools such as:

* generate a **new key pair** with **self-signed certificate**
* add an **existing private key and certificate**
* generate a new *Certificate Sign Request* (**CSR**)
* sign a CSR and produce a **certification chain** (p7b)
